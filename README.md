### Hey there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I’m **Martin Quiroga**, a computer engineering student from Chile.

I build and deploy real systems: web apps, Linux servers, and automation.

I maintain **TenisChile.com** — handling day-to-day updates and ops (AWS/Linux, Nginx + PM2 deployments, backups, production troubleshooting, and shipping fixes/features).

My main stack is **Java, Python, and JavaScript**, and I’m comfortable working end-to-end from code to production.

I’ve got a bunch of pinned projects, but one I’m always working on is **[ValerinSMP](https://www.valerinsmp.com)** — a custom Minecraft server + website + plugins running on Linux.

I’m currently open to **internships / junior developer roles**.

#### Fun Facts:
* I run a self-hosted Minecraft server (CLI-only on Linux)
* I enjoy debugging and performance tuning more than UI polish
* **Hobbies:** gaming, cook, building projects
